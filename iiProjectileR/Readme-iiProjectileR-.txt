+) Section 1. About
===================
  The Projectile Retrieval Mod has a simple aim - to allow the player to retrieve used projectiles. Primarily intended for arrows (though bolts and bullets are supported), the fact that projectile can be retrieved from the environment after use increases the realism of the game (and besides, it's cool to pick up your spent arrows from the bodies of your fallen enemies).

Projectile Retrieval Mod makes use of WeiDU components and groups, to allow the player to customise their experience.
Players can install the retrieval option for any combination of Arrows, Bolts and Bullets.
Players can then further choose which category of the item will be retrievable, with the following options:

Normal items
Only the default item-type will be retrievable, e.g. a plain, non enchanted arrow will be retrievable, whereas an Arrow of Detonation will not be.

All items as normal items
All items will be retrievable as the default item-type, e.g. a plain, non enchanted arrow will be retrievable as a plain, non enchanted arrow, and an Arrow of Detonation will also be retrievable as a plain, non enchanted arrow.

All items as all items
All items will be retrievable as their actual item-type, e.g. a plain, non enchanted arrow will be retrievable as a plain, non enchanted arrow, whereas an Arrow of Detonation will be retrievable as an Arrow of Detonation.
